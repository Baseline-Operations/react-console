/**
 * Vitest setup file
 * 
 * This file runs before each test file and sets up common configurations.
 * Individual tests can override these defaults using their own mocks.

// Empty setup - tests can define their own mocks as needed
// This avoids conflicts with tests that need to mock terminal dimensions themselves
